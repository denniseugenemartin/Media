## Key Features

* User based authentication allows tracking of favorites list by user.
* Consumes multiple APIs to display and track feature rich content.
* In order to conserve limited API calls, information is populated on a  per request basis. As a user requests information stored in database,  the date/time of that information is checked and stale information is  then refreshed on the fly.
*  Each media object is presented with  images, reviews, and a listing of streaming sources, classified by type  (subscription, free, rental, purchase)
* Users can search for specific media or view lists of top-rated or most popular movies and tv shows.\
* Design allows for pagination of large datasets for ease of use.
* User's watchlist can be sorted by individual metrics.
