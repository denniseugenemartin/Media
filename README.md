# Media

Website that allows users to search for movies/tv shows, see details about those shows including Rotten Tomatoes/Metacritic scores and streaming platforms.
Users can create profiles and save media to their "watchlist". There are direct links to the media platforms and all information is dynamically displayed. 
Example: API calls are made to various information sources to collect information to be displayed. API calls are limited so there are a few workarounds to limit
API requests. Any media information that is viewed is saved in the database and only updated if > 7 days has passed since the last request. Users can also browse
media information like top/popular movies or tv shows.
